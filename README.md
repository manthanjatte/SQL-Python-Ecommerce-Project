## 📊 E-commerce Sales Analysis Using Python & MySQL
🔍 Project Overview
This project is designed to simulate a real-world E-commerce data pipeline and analytics system. It demonstrates how CSV data from various e-commerce activities (orders, sales, customers, etc.) is ingested into a MySQL database, queried using SQL, and visualized using Python’s data science stack: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

This project not only includes database ingestion and basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), but also incorporates SQL queries that range from basic to advanced—mirroring real-world analytics requirements for business insights.

## 🔗 Tech Stack
Language: Python 3

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, mysql-connector-python

Database: MySQL

Data Format: CSV

## 🧩 Modules & Components
1. csv_to_sql.py
Connects to a local MySQL database named ecommerce.

Reads multiple CSV files (customers, orders, sales, products, delivery, payments).

Automatically detects data types and creates corresponding tables.

Inserts data efficiently using parameterized queries and handles missing values.

2. python+sql_ecommerce.ipynb
Connects to the MySQL database and uses SQL queries to extract insights.

Uses Pandas for data manipulation.

Visualizes trends like total sales, customer orders, and product performance using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

3. Questions.txt
Contains SQL questions categorized into Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced for analytical practice.

Topics covered: customer demographics, sales trends, revenue insights, growth analysis, retention rates, etc.


## 📊 Sample Insights
Some insights derived using SQL + Python:

Top 3 cities with the highest sales volume.
